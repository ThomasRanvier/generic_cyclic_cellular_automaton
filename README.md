# Generic cyclic 2D cellular automaton

This is an implementation of a generic cyclic 2D cellular automaton.

When the program starts you can enter the rules of the automaton :
- The range
- the threshold (number of next state cells needed in the neighbourhood to upgrade the cell state)
- The number of states
- The type of neighbourhood : Moore or Von-Neumann
